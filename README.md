Step 1: Define the dog food. A broke ass dude
who fell from grace by a sleazy weed startup in SF 
makes his comeback: Skynet. A beautifully elegant and 
potentially dangerous p2p network built around 
AIs that interact with each other and with the 
regular internet, and that uses the crypto 
mining model but applied to edge computational
nodes instead of transaction processing.

HOWEVER, TO DO THIS HE NEEDS MONEY... AND TO RAISE
AN ICO ROUND WITH NO MONEY TO START OFF... WELL THAT IS
A DANGEROUS GAME.

HIS VISION: CREATE HUNDREDS, EVEN THOUSANDS, OF NFTS 
AND NFT SERIES AND SELL THEM TO RAISE THE PRESALE MONEY

THE APPROACH: A PIPELINE: TINKERS TO EVERS TO CHANCE
AKA
STABLE DIFFUSION TO REAL-ESRGAN TO WEBDRIVER-SAFARI 

give it a list of prompts, some pricing logic, and 
Your wallet, and basically you're begging for change 
Selling mediocre art that looks cool if you're stoned


Step 2: Architect the dog food

No way in hell I'm using 3rd party hosted services 
for ersgan or for stable diff. But I don't have a 
GPU rig and I am working in a converted garage 
in central america, with 10 meg internet.

Yes 10 megs, because the 100 meg line got destroyed 
during a nasty argument where wine was thrown and 
the ancient cable modem took a direct hit.

So I have to host these services online, with no money 
to pay for hosting and no card even to get a gcloud free trial

The whole idea of SKYNET is that together we can do 
anything - programmers and citizen devs alike 

In this case, 2 out of 3 modules require a gpu 
and the webdriver safari requires a robust internet
connection and lots of ram. All things I don't have

Enter the Colab. Interactive ipython notebooks on 
Headless Chrome. The free version requires that 
your browser be open, and that you don't run 
web servers... But Axion Receptors with RPC over socket
connectivity? Hell ya.

Each Google account only gets 1 GPU on colab
And we can't fast context switch, the VMS get
Destroyed, a pain in the dick 

So we should use this opportunity to show how multiple
Broke ass dudes can each deploy a different receptor
In the pipeline, and that the pipeline can be 
Created using joint js (what a great name)
